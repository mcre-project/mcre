**Minecraft Rust Edition**: an ambitious attempt to create a faithful, modern 1:1 clone of Minecraft in Rust.

<sub>*“1:1 clone” refers to behaviour, rendering, and functionality. Replicating every legacy bug is not a goal.</sub>

## 🏗️ Design Principles

- **Performance**: Through rigorous performance engineering.
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and sensible configuration.
- **Modular composability**: Use individual components independently or compose them into a complete game.
